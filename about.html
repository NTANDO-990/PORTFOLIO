                    <h3>Introduction.</h3>
                    <p> 
                        Hi there! I'm Ntando, a passionate web developer who transforms ideas into visually stunning and functional websites.
                        I'm a curious being, ready to learn, reinvent anything thrown my way. 
                        With a knack for design and an eye for detail, I love coding as it allows me to dive into my imagination and lets me 
                        bring what's in my head to reality(well digitally).When I'm not coding, I'm exploring creative design trends or geeking 
                        out over the latest tech innovations like how I'm currently learning how to incorperate AI into my developments so I don't get replaced by it. 
                        Let's create something amazing together!
